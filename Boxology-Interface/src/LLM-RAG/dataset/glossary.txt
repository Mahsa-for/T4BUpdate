## Domain: normalization

**embed**: However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise p...
**logic**: Motivated by the querying of feedforward neural networks, we investigate logics for weighted structures
**train**: We propose an integrated framework that enhances rater training, enforces attention through real-time scoring, and streamlines pairwise comparisons to recover quality scores with fewer comparisons
**transform**: Finally, we consider transformations of weighted structures by iterated transductions

### Recent papers in normalization:
1. Recursive querying of neural networks via weighted structures: Expressive querying of machine learning models - viewed as a form of intentional data - enables their verification and interpretation using declarative languages, thereby making learned representations of data more accessible. Motivated by the que...
2. Local Asymptotic Normality for Mixed Fractional Brownian Motion Under High-Frequency Observation: In this paper we will consider the LAN property for both the Hurst parameter $H>3/4$ and the variance of the fractional Brownian motion plus an independent standard Brownian motion (called mixed fractional Brownian motion) with high-frequency obse...

## Domain: transformation

**conditions**: Starting from Sommerfeld spectral representations, the transmission conditions on the two wedge faces yield a closed spectral functional system for the Sommerfeld transforms $Q(ζ)$ and $S(ζ)$
**logic**: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies
**sets**: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments
**train**: We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints
**transform**: Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology

Let's OWL make sense of it: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments.

2. Diffraction by a Right-Angle Dielectric Wedge: Closed-Form Solution for $ν=\sqrt{2}$: We consider the two-dimensional time-harmonic transmission problem for an impedance-matched ($ρ=1$) right-angle dielectric wedge at refractive index ratio $ν=sqrt(2)$, in the integrable lemniscatic configuration $(θ_w, ν, ρ)=(π/4, \sqrt(2), 1)$. S...

**knowledge**: The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL
**logic**: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies
**modeling**: Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling

## Domain: clustered data

**clustered**: Clustered and longitudinal data are pervasive in scientific studies, from prenatal health programs to clinical trials and public health surveillance
**clustering**: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods
**embed**: The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a se...
**k-means**: Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means
**modeling**: Through applications to modern prenatal care, a longitudinal toenail infection trial, and clustered health count data, we show that GCR not only achieves superior predictive performance over standard methods, but also reveals family-, community-, ...
**sets**: Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of datasets
**transform**: By applying a generalized $z$-transformation, GCR guarantees valid correlation matrices, accommodates unbalanced cluster sizes, and flexibly incorporates covariates such as time, space, or group membership into the dependence structure

2. EmbedOR: Provable Cluster-Preserving Visualizations with Curvature-Based Stochastic Neighbor Embeddings: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected components of the underlying...
